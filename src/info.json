  "ProfessionalSummary": "Enthusiastic and highly motivated Computer Science student with a passion for all things coding and a proven ability to learn quickly. This past few years I have been going deep into web development and have become proficient in javascript, Typescripts, and related web technologies for the front end, my preferred framework is Solidjs. I have continuously expanded my skill set and love learning new things. My favorite backend language is Go, since it is fairly straightforward to learn and allows me to build really performant and small backends, I also have experience with Nodejs, and Nextjs, as well as Flutter for mobile app development. Furthermore, I have some experience with AWS using ec2 instances, as well as setting up my own server in Ubuntu using nginx and getting SSL certification with Certbot. I have some experience with lower-level programming languages, I built a chessBot engine in c that used bit boards, and this project was what prompted me to build my online ChessUI.",
